# MSE3114
Introduction to Python for MSE students part 2.  

This course was first taught Fall 2020 and is under continual development as I advance in python myself.
The goal of the course is to help Materials Science and Engineering sophomore/juniors to become familiar enough with python to write code and adapt code from the community to help solve problems they will come across as engineers.  
The lessons are motivated by a specific application and then we learn enough python to solve our problem.  

This course requires an anaconda install as we primarily use the jupyter interface.
